      Introduction:
        text: |
          Roadtripper API is a REST API, each request use the **HTTP** protocol.;;;
          Each request paths (exept {{/ping:get-ping}}) must be prefixed by the current major version of the api server. Since we are in version **1.-.-**, paths
          must be prefixed by **/v1**;;;
          For example, the url of the login request ( {{/auth/login:get-auth-login}} ) is */v1/auth/login*
